## Key Steps  

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
- Loaded the dataset and examined its structure and attributes.  
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and ensuring consistency.  
- Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key variables.  

### 2. Analysis and Insights  
- **Cancellation Trends:**  
  - Found that 37% of bookings were canceled, significantly impacting revenue.  
  - Observed that cancellations peak in January and during periods with higher room rates.  

- **Booking Patterns:**  
  - City hotels received more bookings than resort hotels.  
  - Higher prices correlated with higher cancellation rates.  

- **Customer Segments:**  
  - Analyzed market segments, finding that 46% of bookings were made via online travel agencies, while direct bookings accounted for only 4%.  

- **Geographic Trends:**  
  - Found that the highest number of cancellations came from customers in Portugal (country code `PRT`).  

### 3. Visualization  
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create detailed visualizations, including:  
  - Bar graphs for cancellation rates and monthly booking trends.  
  - Line graphs comparing average daily rates (ADR) of city and resort hotels.  
  - Market segment distribution analysis.  
  - Country-wise cancellation distribution.
